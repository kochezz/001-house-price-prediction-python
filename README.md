# üè† House Price Prediction Case Study

This project uses a real estate dataset to build a multiple linear regression (MLR) model that predicts the selling price of houses (in million Rs) based on several predictors. The data consists of 198 rows and 5 columns containing the following information:
- **Selling Price** (in million Rs)
- **Carpet Area** (in square feet)
- **Distance from Nearest Metro Station** (in kilometers)
- **Number of Schools Within 2 km** of the house


---

## üìã Objectives / Questions Addressed

1. **Data Import & Structure Check**  
   - Import the House Price data and examine its structure.

2. **Data Splitting**  
   - Split the data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) datasets.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Build a regression model on the training data to estimate the selling price of a house.

4. **Variable Significance & Interpretation**  
   - Identify significant predictors and interpret their regression coefficients.

5. **Model Fit Metrics**  
   - Report the R¬≤ and Adjusted R¬≤ of the model along with their interpretations.

6. **Multicollinearity Assessment**  
   - Check for multicollinearity (e.g., using VIF) and perform necessary steps to address it.

7. **Influential Observations**  
   - Identify any influential observations that might disproportionately affect the model.

8. **Error Normality**  
   - Assess if the model residuals (errors) follow a normal distribution.

9. **Heteroscedasticity Check**  
   - Evaluate for heteroscedasticity by plotting residuals versus the predictors.

10. **Model Performance**  
    - Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both Training and Testing datasets.

| **Step**                         | **Description**                                      | **Key Metrics/Visuals**                  | **Interpretation Notes**                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Data Check**                | Import data and examine structure                    | `.info()`, `.head()`                      | Ensure correct data types and no missing values                |
| **2. Data Split**                | Train-test split (80/20)                             | `train_test_split()`                      | Prevent data leakage, ensure fair model evaluation             |
| **3. Model Building**            | Fit MLR model using training set                     | `.summary()` (statsmodels)                | Review model fit and statistical output                        |
| **4. Coefficient Analysis**      | Identify significant variables                       | p-values < 0.05                           | Only significant variables should be interpreted               |
| **5. Model Fit**                 | Evaluate R¬≤ and Adjusted R¬≤                          | R¬≤, Adj R¬≤                                | How much variance in selling price is explained                |
| **6. Multicollinearity**         | Check with VIF                                       | `variance_inflation_factor()`             | VIF > 5‚Äì10 suggests strong multicollinearity                   |
| **7. Influential Observations**  | Identify outliers affecting model                    | Leverage plots, Cook‚Äôs Distance           | Influential points may distort regression                     |

| **9. Heteroscedasticity**        | Test variance of residuals across predictors         | Residual vs. fitted/predictor plots       | Look for "funnel" shape; should ideally be constant            |
